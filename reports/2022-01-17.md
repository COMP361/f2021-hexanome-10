### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * *We are having trouble with access tokens so we get 401 errors.*
 * *Many of us experience issues with Java constantly which prevents us from doing real coding (e.g. cannot find class, import errors, etc.)*
 * *Some members are having trouble with understanding the code/what to do, making it difficult for them to participate.*

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * *Our images are too big and don't look nice together. We need to downsize.*
 * *A game service needs to become a game session when a player joins that game first. Therefore we need to display both services and sessions in the available games screen.*
 * *Our MinuetoObjects are being created at every single frame refresh. We need to ensure they are created only once for better performance.*

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

 * *Login 401 errors because of access tokens*
