### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * *We are having trouble deciding if display...() methods should be included in the environment and operation models*
 * *Changes are constantly being made in some models, which results in more work for the other related models*
 * *Unable to reach Gabriel :(*

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * *Making the server responsible for game states will make models simpler and will not affect performance much*
 * *According to the Catan example, the environment model doesn't need to specify the players in the parameters*
 * *Ryan says we should talk to the prof ASAP to discuss Gabriel being MIA.*

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

 * *Textboxes need a key to be pressed in order to fill with text - still not fixed. We will focus on this once M4 is complete.*
 * *The boot does not start in the correct village - still not fixed. We will focus on this once M4 is complete.*
