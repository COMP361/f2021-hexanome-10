### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * *We were all busy with other classes this week so we did not work on this class at all.*
 * *Re-organizing our main class into separate classes was hard to do alone, because Lilia did not know what could be moved and what could not. We will need to review this as a team.*

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * *Separating our main code into files will require most of the team so we can know what is safe to remove.*
 * *We will all need to dedicate more time to this class in the upcoming weeks to make up for this lost week.*
 * *We should comment our code more so we do not require the help of others while coding.*

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

 * *Textboxes need a key to be pressed in order to fill with text*
 * *The boot does not start in the correct village.*
