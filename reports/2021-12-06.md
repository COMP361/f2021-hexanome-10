### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * *It took us a very long time to figure out how the network should be coded, which prevented us from working on the GUI.*
 * *Stuck with an error in the lobby service until Wednesday which prevented us from completing the Lobby Service on time*
 * *Dijian and Lingjia were busy with other classes so we couldn't use their help for M5. Still unable to reach Gabriel :(*

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * *Java does not support more than one Main class. We need to rename them to ServerMain, ClientMain, NetworkMain*
 * *Next time we are stuck on a bug, we should communicate with the TAs sooner so we can finalize our code on time.*
 * *The advanced rest client will create code for us to use.*

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

 * *Our Game class is broken since the last push*
 * *One of the boots does not start in the correct village, but the others do.*
 * *Writing in the text box isn't smooth.*
