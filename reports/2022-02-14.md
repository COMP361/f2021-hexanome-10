### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * *The Lobby Service does not run 24/7 on the network. We will make it run in the background to avoid connection errors in the future.*
 * *Game services can have multiple sessions. We have decided we want to prevent this and it will require extra work.*
 * *Minueto does not support the color PURPLE. We need to create purple images for our PURPLE player.*

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * *It is useless for the user to send lobby service request through the server. We will switch so the user sends direct requests to LS.*
 * *The lobby service wasn't working because we hadn't pulled the code in a while. We need to check for LS updates more regularly.*
 * *We all need to review M6 since some of us are more familiar with the code.*

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

 * *getUsers stopped working*
