### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

- _The Lobby Service does not run 24/7 on the network. We will make it run in the background to avoid connection errors in the future._
- _Game services can have multiple sessions. We have decided we want to prevent this and it will require extra work._
- _Minueto does not support the color PURPLE. We need to create purple images for our PURPLE player._

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

- _It is useless for the user to send lobby service request through the server. We will switch so the user sends direct requests to LS._
- _The lobby service wasn't working because we hadn't pulled the code in a while. We need to check for LS updates more regularly._
- _We all need to review M6 since some of us are more familiar with the code._

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

- _getUsers stopped working_
